# Prompt 2: For the VoiceLink Claude Code Agent

> **Purpose**: Give this prompt to the Claude Code instance running on the `voicelink.me` codebase, along with TWO files:
> 1. `FINIT_STYLE_GUIDE.md` (generated by the Finit agent)
> 2. `SAAS-RESEARCH_voicelink-optimization.md` (the SaaS research document, included alongside this prompt)

---

## The Prompt

```
You have two reference documents:

1. `FINIT_STYLE_GUIDE.md` — The complete design system of finitsolutions.be. This is the source of truth for ALL visual styling. VoiceLink is a product by Finit Solutions and must look like it belongs to the exact same brand.

2. `SAAS-RESEARCH_voicelink-optimization.md` — Research-backed best practices for structuring a high-converting SaaS product website. Use this for content strategy, section ordering, and conversion optimization.

## YOUR MISSION

Restyle and optimize the VoiceLink website (voicelink.me) so that:

### A. VISUAL IDENTITY — Match Finit Solutions exactly
Apply every design token from `FINIT_STYLE_GUIDE.md`:

- **Colors**: Replace ALL current colors with the Finit color system. Primary, secondary, accent, backgrounds, text colors, gradients — everything must match.
- **Typography**: Switch to the exact fonts, weights, and sizing scale from Finit. Import the same font files/Google Fonts. Match heading styles, body text, and caption styles.
- **Buttons**: Restyle all CTAs to match Finit's button styles exactly — same border-radius, padding, colors, hover states, transitions.
- **Cards**: Match Finit's card styling — background, border, radius, shadow, padding.
- **Spacing**: Adopt Finit's spacing scale — section padding, container widths, component gaps.
- **Animations**: Implement the same scroll animations and transitions — same library, same durations, same easing.
- **Effects**: Match shadows, border-radii, glassmorphism, gradients, decorative elements.
- **Navigation**: Restyle the nav/header to match Finit's — same layout pattern, same styling, but with VoiceLink's logo and nav items.
- **Footer**: Match Finit's footer styling pattern.

The end result should look like finitsolutions.be and voicelink.me were designed in the same Figma file by the same designer. A visitor going from one site to the other should feel ZERO visual disconnect.

### B. CONTENT STRUCTURE — Optimize for conversions
Referring to `SAAS-RESEARCH_voicelink-optimization.md`, restructure the page sections to follow the optimal SaaS landing page flow:

1. **Hero** → Headline (outcome-focused, not feature-focused) + subheading + primary CTA + secondary CTA + product visual + carousel
2. **Trust/Social Proof Bar** → CRM integration logos and/or metrics
3. **Problem Agitation** → Short empathy section naming the pain (2-4 lines max)
4. **How It Works** → 3-step process (Connect → Speak → Done)
5. **Features/Benefits** → 4-6 benefit-led cards
6. **Product Demo/Visual** → Screenshot, animation, or video showing the product
7. **Integrations** → Supported CRMs grid
8. **Testimonials** → Social proof (even if placeholder for now)
9. **Pricing** → 2-3 tiers with free trial option
10. **FAQ** → Accordion, objection-handling focus
11. **Final CTA** → Warm closing CTA
12. **Footer**

**CRITICAL**: Preserve the existing GOOD content from the current VoiceLink site. The current copy and section content is decent — your job is to:
- Reorganize it into the optimal flow above
- Fill any GAPS (if a recommended section doesn't exist, create it with placeholder content that fits the VoiceLink product)
- Trim any redundancy
- Rewrite headlines to be outcome-focused where they're currently feature-focused
- Ensure every section has ONE clear takeaway
- Do NOT delete content that's working well — migrate it to the right position in the new flow

### C. THE CAROUSEL — Implement the Finit SVG Path Carousel
This is a signature design element. In the FINIT_STYLE_GUIDE.md you'll find the complete carousel implementation — the SVG path, animation code, and styling.

**For VoiceLink, implement this carousel in the hero section but creatively adapted:**

Instead of showing integration tool logos like the Finit site does, display **the journey of a voice note being processed**. Along the same curved SVG path, animate these elements flowing continuously:

- A WhatsApp voice note bubble / waveform icon
- A transcription/text snippet icon
- An AI/brain processing icon
- A CRM card/database icon
- A checkmark/success icon
- Then repeat the sequence

This creates a visual metaphor: the user's voice "flows" through the system, from WhatsApp input to CRM output. It tells the VoiceLink story in a single glance.

**Alternatively** (if the above is too complex to make look polished), use the same carousel to display supported CRM logos — Teamleader, HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zoho, Monday.com, etc. — just like Finit displays tool logos. This directly communicates compatibility in the hero.

**Technical requirements for the carousel:**
- Use the EXACT same SVG `<path>` data and `viewBox` from the Finit implementation
- Match animation speed, direction, and easing exactly
- Apply the same edge-fade/mask effect if present in the Finit version
- Ensure smooth performance (use CSS transforms, `will-change`, or `requestAnimationFrame`)
- Must be responsive and work on mobile

### D. MICRO-OPTIMIZATIONS
Apply these conversion best practices from the research:

- **Sticky header with CTA**: Navigation should stick on scroll with a visible CTA button
- **Single CTA color**: Use the primary accent color ONLY for CTA buttons — trains the visitor's eye
- **Whitespace**: Generous section padding. Crowded = cheap. Breathing room = premium.
- **Mobile-first**: Every section must work flawlessly at 375px width. CTAs must be thumb-friendly (min 48px).
- **Page speed**: Lazy load below-fold images, compress assets, minimize JS
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy (single h1, h2s for sections, h3s for cards)
- **Meta tags**: Optimize title, description, OG tags for "WhatsApp CRM automation" / "voice CRM assistant"

### E. WHAT NOT TO CHANGE
- Don't change the VoiceLink logo (just ensure it's styled consistently with the new design)
- Don't change the core product messaging/positioning — VoiceLink is a WhatsApp voice-to-CRM assistant
- Don't introduce design elements that aren't in the Finit style guide (no new colors, no different fonts, no conflicting border-radii)
- Don't add stock photography

## PROCESS
1. First, read both reference documents completely
2. Audit the current VoiceLink codebase — note what exists, what's good, what needs to change
3. Create a plan before making changes
4. Implement the styling overhaul first (colors, fonts, spacing, components)
5. Then restructure the page sections
6. Then implement the carousel
7. Then apply micro-optimizations
8. Finally, test responsive behavior at 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
9. Verify the site matches the Finit visual identity by comparing them side by side

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
When done, a visitor should:
- Instantly recognize VoiceLink as a Finit Solutions product
- Understand what VoiceLink does within 5 seconds of landing
- See a clear path to trying the product (CTA above the fold)
- Feel the site is professional, trustworthy, and modern
- Have all their objections answered by the time they reach the bottom
- Experience smooth animations and fast load times on any device
